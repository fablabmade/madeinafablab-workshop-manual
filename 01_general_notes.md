# General Notes

## Introduction

Made in a Fab Lab Workshop objective is to provide a broad overview of the process of turning a technological prototype into a real product, building a digital design, using digital fabrication for production, and following the lean startup approach for business aspects.

During the workshop we'll first learn the basics of all the above, then we will apply this metodology to several real world projects, inspired by the current market trends.

## Methodology

In order to be more engaging for  participants, the workshop follows a roleplay approach. 

Participants will be divided in groups and each one will represent a startup team including all the roles: management, communication, production, marketing and R&D.

Each group will be led by a product manager who will be in charge of coordinating his team work and presenting the results of each dayâ€™s activities.

Ideally, every day a new product manager will be selected, so all the participants will experience all the different roles.

In order to fully achieve the workshop objectives it is very important to respect the proposed schedule and make sure that participants have access to all the necessary tools and materials.

For this reason each of the proposed project briefs integrates a bill of materials and a number of pre-made parts which will be easily customized by the workshop participants.

During the work participants will be introduced to different tools typical of the lean startup, such as the business canvas, kanban boards, MVPs, A/B testing, but will also deal with the design, fabrication and integration of the products.


## Project selection criteria

The proposed products have been selected in order to address the following:

- represent large market trends (consumer electronics, wearables, automation)
- being easy to customize in shape, materials and production means
- allowing fast integration and prototyping cycles using digital fabrication
- requiring teamwork to produce an acceptable result
- be engaging and fun to make
