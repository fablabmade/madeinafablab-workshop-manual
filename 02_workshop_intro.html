<h2 id="what-is-made-in-a-fab-lab">What is Made in a Fab Lab</h2>
<p>Made in a Fab Lab is an atypical brand, created by Francisco Sanchez, available as open-source to anyone who wants to make and sell products built according to the principles of the Made in a Fab Lab Manifesto.</p>
<p>This way your product can gets immediately recognised as carrying the values of ethical and sustainable local production from a global design.</p>
<p>But it is also a tool to help us increase the awareness on this topic and prove that much can be still done using the power of the Fab Lab Network.</p>
<h2 id="made-in-a-fab-lab-manifesto">Made in a Fab Lab Manifesto</h2>
<p>The Made in a Fab Lab Manifesto was created for and by makers, biohackers and whoever else wants to promote self-made products that can be produced globally with a sustainable approach.</p>
<p>Anybody can use the Manifesto as a guideline for creating and distributing products locally in a Fab Lab or Makerspace.</p>
<p>A Manifesto for Global Design and Local Production</p>
<ul>
<li>Fab Lab Made products include daily used objects, as well as art and design</li>
<li>All labour involved in their production is fairly compensated</li>
<li>Fab Lab Made products favour re-used, upcycled and local materials</li>
<li>Shared designs with open source licences keep their value over time and should be preferred</li>
<li>Designers and collaborators are fairly compensated for each product sold, even if their design is open</li>
<li>Fab Lab Made products are not harmful, dangerous or illegal</li>
<li>Fab Labs with the standard setup are able to produce most products</li>
<li>Production is mainly targeted at local markets, long distance shipping is avoided as it hurts the planet</li>
<li>Competition between labs shouldn&#x2019;t exist as we are all part of the same global community</li>
<li>The Fab Lab made label only aim is the sustainability of the global fab lab network and its members</li>
