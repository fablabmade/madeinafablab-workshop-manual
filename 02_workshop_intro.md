## What is Made in a Fab Lab

Made in a Fab Lab is an atypical brand, created by Francisco Sanchez, available as open-source to anyone who wants to make and sell products built according to the principles of the Made in a Fab Lab Manifesto.

This way your product can gets immediately recognised as carrying the values of ethical and sustainable local production from a global design.

But you also help us increase the awareness on this topic and prove that much can be still done using the power of the Fab Lab Network.

## Made in a Fab Lab Manifesto

The Made in a Fab Lab Manifesto was created for and by makers, biohackers and whoever else wants to promote self-made products that can be produced globally with a sustainable approach.

Anybody can use the Manifesto as a guideline for creating and distributing products locally in a Fab Lab or Makerspace.

A Manifesto for Global Design and Local Production

- Fab Lab Made products include daily used objects, as well as art and design
- All labour involved in their production is fairly compensated
- Fab Lab Made products favour re-used, upcycled and local materials
- Shared designs with open source licences keep their value over time and should be preferred
- Designers and collaborators are fairly compensated for each product sold, even if their design is open
- Fab Lab Made products are not harmful, dangerous or illegal
- Fab Labs with the standard setup are able to produce most products
- Production is mainly targeted at local markets, long distance shipping is avoided as it hurts the planet
- Competition between labs shouldnâ€™t exist as we are all part of the same global community
- The Fab Lab made label only aim is the sustainability of the global fab lab network and its members
