# Project requirements

You need to define project requirements in order to know what to build and why.

This is usually a long process as it requires extracting requirements from a number of different kinds of users, not keen to define what they need in terms
of clear language.

Definining requirements means also understanding the product domain, being able to sketch out the possible users for the product and how they will use it during their daily routines.

A number of techniques exist to define requirements, the one we will use can be described as follows.

## Identifying stakeholders or personas

We first try to guess who will benefit for using our product. These are called stakeholders or in more modern models, personas.

Each persona should be sketched as a real person. It is useful to give a name and draft a short profile for each persona.

According to their profile each persona will have needs, expressions of the problem to solve with our product.

For each need we should provide a solution, in terms of how the person will use our product to solve it.

## Use cases

For each case that our product is used we can define a use-case. This will have the form of a title, a number of actions perfomed by the user or by the product, and the expected outcomes achieved.

Special consideration must be taken for exceptions: the cases in which given a wrong input our product will handle failure gracefully.

## Explicit requirements

Once we identified the use cases, we can classify the actual requirements.

These should take the form of simple sentences, subject verb object

The requirements will drive our design phase and all the subsequent ones.

Each requirements will be categorized in Mandatory, Optional, Nice to have.

This way we can make sure to have all the mandatory requirements implemented into our MVP, to be able to validate fully our product with the testing phase.

The requirements will be organized into three main categories:

- functional requirements: defining what the product does 

- usability requirements: describing the details that should be taken into account in order to make a more usable product

- technical requirements: all the details about the product's technical features, as well as electrical / electronic components necessary for its operation
