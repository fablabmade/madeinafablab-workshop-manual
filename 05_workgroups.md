# Workgroups

Creating a product is group work. In order to succeed you need to involve different professionals into your team, either as part of the staff or as external consultants.

In a typical company you will have:

- CEO: the person at the lead of the company strategy, reporting and working with investors and advisors, and coordinating the management team

- CFO: dealing with funding, taxes, banks and customer deals

- CTO: a technical person, usually an engineer overseeing the technical team and r&d

- Marketing & Communication: overseeing all the relationships with the external world, website, advertising, social media

- Human Resources: managing human resources into the company

- CIO: supporting enterprise computing and IT infrastructure

Plus several product managers, operation managers, design managers, who report to the CEO for specific product lines, etc.

## Groups organization

For the Made in a Fab Lab Workshop we aim to define the following figures:

- CEO: coordinates the work, presents the product pitch, drafts the business canvas and chooses the members of the group.

- CTO / Designer: Oversees the production and works with the R&D on the creation of the product MVP. 

- Marketing: Oversees all the customer analysis and is responsible for the branding, website and packaging for the product.

- CFO: Responsible for the business planning and funding plan. Responsible to create the product pitch presentation and to work on the Business canvas.

- Product Manager: the advocate of the product, coordinates the product development and plays the role of the customer during all activities. Defines the production plan.
