## A/B Testing

You can maximise your site’s earning potential by giving your visitors the best possible experience and A/B testing is a proven way of finding out precisely what works.

Once your site is established and has some traffic, you need to make the most of its earning potential. So your next move should be to begin A/B testing. A/B testing is the tried-and-trusted ‘secret sauce’ that drives high-quality sites higher. In the simplest type of A/B test, visitors to your site are randomly shown one of two variants of an existing page.

A set of tools that you’ve set up then records the time spent on the page, the bounce rate and other data – it’s a scientific way of deciding which of your two pages is the most effective option. In this post, we’ll explain how to set up A/B testing in WordPress, and show you how to run experiments on your site, for free.
