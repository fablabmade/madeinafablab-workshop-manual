# Marketing & Communication


## Brand and identity

Defining your project branding is very important to make it stand out from the competition and to become an added value for future projects.

There are many ways to create a brand, from DIY to thousand dollar bills for famous design studios.

In any case you can start with a self-made graphics and move to a fancier one when the product is on the shelfs.

The identity should include color and black and white versions, optimized for print. Adapt your identity to best represent the product values and your market segment. I.e. blue color for medical products, green color for energy products.

Take inspiration from major brands and opt for simple geometric shapes.

## Marketing materials

Once you defined your brand identity, you should be able to use it in different materials.

The bare minimum will be a web-friendly version of your logo in png format,
and a color theme for the splash website.

## Project Video

The first way to promote your product is to make an interesting video, not
necessary longer than 30 seconds.

The video should answer the most common questions immediately:

- Who are you?
- What does your product?
- How do you use it?
- Why it is better then the others?
- How do I get it?

You can also make several additional videos highlighting a specific feature
or use of your product. Think about the Apple commercials.

## Project Website

A lean website is a minimum for any product. People will look at it while deciding what to buy, checking for a new model or looking for support answers.

A splash webiste is enough for a new product. Just one page with pictures describing the features and allowing for example to pre-order the product when available.

As you have more content, you can add new pages and start to redesign a more complex site.

A pre-order form can be easily developed with [Google Forms](http://forms.google.com).

If you want just to collect the email addresses you can use Mailchimp

The majority of users come from mobile. Make sure your website can be rendered optimally from a smartphone.


## A/B Testing

You can maximise your product potential by giving your customers the best possible experience and A/B testing is a proven way of finding out precisely what works.

For using A/B testing you set up two different pages on your website for example.

In each you will write different marketing slogans, or hilight a different feature of your project.

Then you will promote separately the two addresses, for example using marketing
campaigns on Google.

Google provides everything needed to check which pages are more appreciated, and understanding this way what your customers like best.

This way you will be able to use your customers to improve a little by a little
all the content of your marketing materials.


### Social media

You should consider social media as one of the most active channels for hi-tech products and local communities.

Post nice looking pictures and short but effective copy to attract visitors and future customers.

Make sure you cover the main social media in your area, those that people use most will work.

Social media only work if they are updated often. Twice a day is a common strategy.

In order to maximize social media impact, a posting calendar is often used, planning the publishing of posts at regular intervals.

Some tools exist to automate these tasks, such as [Hootsuite](http://hootsuite.com). They also provide help in tracking social interactions with the customers.
