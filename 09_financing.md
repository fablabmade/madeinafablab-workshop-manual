# Budget

Your funding goal should be the minimum amount you need to make the required quantity of products to test your idea or fullfil your existing orders.

## How to figure out a budget

- Make a list of all the possible expenses, starting from the bill of materials, but also including anything from screws to envelopes.

- Add taxes and any kind of commission for your business model. Paypal takes 3% for every transaction, you might have to grant discounts to local shops offering your product. Add a fixed percentage for bank expenses.

- Make sure your work and those of who helped you with open-source resources get properly compensated. 

>TIP: Ask for an average salary for an engineer or other professional in your country, divide it by 20 and you have a one day of work pay, multiply it by the days you need to work on the project for an estimate.

# Financing options

## Self-funding

Group with friends and family and invest in your idea. Also
having co-funders will help gathering some initial money to 
start production. Aim low for producing a small series before investing all your family's savings.

## Angel investors

Angels invested over $20 billion in 2014, financing over 70,000 companies. Usually an angel investor is an entrepreneur who has already built a successful company and now wants to invest in new ideas and help you build your company. 

Angel investor Chris Sacca invested $25,000 and a lot of time in Twitter, a bet that helped Twitter grow and gave him approximately $1 billion worth of shares.

For your company, develop a target list of angel investors. Work from this list to manage the entire process. Be sure to keep notes from each conversation and incorporate feedback into your next conversation.  The easiest way to reach a lot of angel investors is through angel groups.

## Incubators

A business incubator is an entity that helps new startups develop their business with advice, startup services, and often times office space. They are either for-profit, non-profit, or government / University sponsored.

## Crowdfunding

Crowdfunding is a relatively new phenomenon. Platforms like Kickstarter, Indiegogo and GoFundMe make raising money straightforward because they streamline the processes of giving entrepreneurs access to a large volume of potential investors.

**Exercise: go to kickstarter.com and check successful projects. Write down how much they asked initially, how much they got and how the project go. Find at least one unsuccessful project**


## Venture capital

 Today, many venture capitalists make early and later stage investments. That means you might not get all the money at once, but you have the potential to get more as you prove success through traction. 
 But you have to have a solid plan in place first. Find someone you know to make a warm introduction. Donâ€™t cold call -- ever. You will not get a favorable response. Make sure your pitch is solid and that you have strategic partners in place, customer validation, and your advisors ready to be a reference.
