# Financing options

## Self-funding

Group with friends and family and invest in your idea. Also
having co-funders will help gathering some initial money to 
start production. Aim low for producing a small series before investing all your family's savings.

## Angel investors. 

Angels invested over $20 billion in 2014, financing over 70,000 companies. Usually an angel investor is an entrepreneur who has already built a successful company and now wants to invest in new ideas and help you build your company. 

Angel investor Chris Sacca invested $25,000 and a lot of time in Twitter, a bet that helped Twitter grow and gave him approximately $1 billion worth of shares.

For your company, develop a target list of angel investors. Work from this list to manage the entire process. Be sure to keep notes from each conversation and incorporate feedback into your next conversation.  The easiest way to reach a lot of angel investors is through angel groups.

## Crowdfunding

Crowdfunding is a relatively new phenomenon. Platforms like Kickstarter, Indiegogo and GoFundMe make raising money straightforward because they streamline the processes of giving entrepreneurs access to a large volume of potential investors.

## Venture capital

 Today, many venture capitalists make early and later stage investments. That means you might not get all the money at once, but you have the potential to get more as you prove success through traction. 
 But you have to have a solid plan in place first. Find someone you know to make a warm introduction. Donâ€™t cold call -- ever. You will not get a favorable response. Make sure your pitch is solid and that you have strategic partners in place, customer validation, and your advisors ready to be a reference.
