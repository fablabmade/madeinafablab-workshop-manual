# Production 

## Planning production

Make sure there is sufficient capacity to meet the demand forecast.

A carefully developed production plan will allow your company to meet the following objectives:

•  Minimize costs / maximize profits

•  Maximize customer service

•  Minimize inventory investment

•  Minimize changes in production rates

•  Minimize changes in work-force levels

•  Maximize the utilization of plant and equipment

## Demand forecasting 

"How many products will I need to produce in August 2017?"

Make an estimate of products needed for each time period, make it a month, or three.

Define what needs to be produced, and then using the BOM what needs to purchased, how many man hours will be needed, and so on.

If you have more than one product, make individual estimates
and then aggregate them into a single list of products.

## Plan to meet the requirements

Define how to cover the forecasted requirements, both on the production level (hiring staff, buying machinery, finding external suppliers) and on the financial level (for production and tools costs)

Make different plans and compare them to find the one with the lowest cost.

## How to deal with flexible demand

Produce just-in-time, hire staff or use existing services for scaling the production only when needed.

Many models exist for this problem, re: Demand Chase vs Level production strategy.

## Relying on third parties 

Production can be a difficult process, especially for large batches.

You can deal with local production for the first few thousands parts without setting up a factory. After that you should consider alternative production models.

Networking with other labs can be an option. 

Finally delegating production to a third party can scale to millions of parts in the long run.
