# Production 

## Planning production

Make sure there is sufficient capacity to meet the demand forecast.

A carefully developed production plan will allow your company to meet the following objectives:

•  Minimize costs / maximize profits

•  Maximize customer service

•  Minimize inventory investment

•  Minimize changes in production rates

•  Minimize changes in work-force levels

•  Maximize the utilization of plant and equipment

## Demand forecasting 

"How many products will I need to produce in August 2017?"

Make an estimate of products needed for each time period, make it a month, or three.

Define what needs to be produced, and then using the BOM what needs to purchased, how many man hours will be needed, and so on.

If you have more than one product, make individual estimates
and then aggregate them into a single list of products.

## Plan to meet the requirements

Define how to cover the forecasted requirements, both on the production level (hiring staff, buying machinery, finding external suppliers) and on the financial level (for production and tools costs)

Make different plans and compare them to find the one with the lowest cost.

## How to deal with flexible demand

Produce just-in-time, hire staff or use existing services for scaling the production only when needed.

Many models exist for this problem, re: Demand Chase vs Level production strategy.

## Relying on third parties 

Production can be a difficult process, especially for large batches.

You can deal with local production for the first few thousands parts without setting up a factory. After that you should consider alternative production models.

Networking with other labs can be an option. 

Finally delegating production to a third party can scale to millions of parts in the long run.

# Sales and order fulfillment

Once your product is ready to be produced, you should figure out:

- How / where to sell your product: online, in shops, in large consumer stores,  only via resellers

- How will you get your product to the customer from the factory or local shop.
  This will often involve shipping to a warehouse and getting in place agreements with courier services.

For massively produced goods the two items above are really problematic, and companies spend years for achieving an optimal sales and logistic network.

For Made in a Fab Lab products this will be reduced to a short checklist:

- How much stock you can afford to produce and keep ready for shipping

- Which are the channels you want to use for selling your product, maybe a friend's shop or only online through your website, or just directly.

- Even if shipping locally you might want to consider finding out a local
courier service or to arrange a dropout location at a local post office.

In any size of business you will need to make invoices and keep accounting records. Many online services allow you to track accounting using your
browser. One example is [Quickbooks](http://quickbooks.com).

Some offer also integration with online shopping platforms such as
[Shopify](http://shopify.com) which you could also consider for your online
sales, but only when you have more than one product.

**Shipping costs must be taken into account very seriously. Designing a compact product and packaging can save substantial amounts.**

## Getting payed

In order to get payed for your online sales, you will need to setup an online
account for this purpose, usually on [Paypal](http://paypal.com) or [Stripe](http://stripe.com). Both will require a commission for each sale, and to verify your account linking a credit-card or a bank account.

You will be asked for such an account when activating a Shopify account or pretty any other online ecommerce system.
