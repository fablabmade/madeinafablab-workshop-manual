## Machines controlled by the computer

What is the difference

G-code is the code used by machines to receive instructions from the computer.

For 3D printers the G-Code is produced by a Slicing software, for CNC Mills by a CAM software, and for the others by specific applications.

G-Code looks like this:

    O8001
    N10 (Digit "1")
    N20 (AUTHOR - NAME)
    N30 G00 X[#502*0.5+#500] Y[#502*1.0+#501] Z[#503+0.2]
    N40 Z[#503+0.05]
    N50 G01 Z[#503-#504]
    N60 Y#501
    N70 G00 Z[#503+0.2]
    N80 M99

i.e. G0 is the command to move the machine head
