# Designing a product digitally

## Key concepts

Designing a product requires a careful understanding of the brief and the requirements. 

Starting from these elements designers usually try to understand the product's **mood** collecting inspiration from different sources including other projects, magazines, websites, art and design collections.

Knowing the product's competitors is also very important, as a design must differentiate a product to make it unique based on looks, style, innovation.

Finally most of the modern designs have origin in the past. We talk in this case about re-design. Famous examples include cars: Fiat 500 and Mini were a huge success in two different decades, still keeping a link from the old version to the new version, much like a DNA.

What is different with a digital design compared to the traditional one?

The main difference is in the speed of execution and flexibility of the outputs. A digital design can be made in thousands of variants just changing few parameters. It can be scaled easily and also adapted to different customers with few clicks.

In order to be able to produce digital design we must learn how to use Computer Aided Modeling software packages. Knowing the right tool for each task can significantly reduce the time required and thus cost.
