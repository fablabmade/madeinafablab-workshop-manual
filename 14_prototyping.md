# Prototyping

The main idea behind prototyping is not only that of developing an initial version of a product, adding features and testing functionality.

A prototype can also serve as a business development tool. Customers often only know they want something after they see it, and when it comes to understanding what a product does the same applies to coworkers and other people in your business.

## Minimum Viable Product

With the new Lean Startup movement the idea of prototype is given a major role in a project success. With this methodology we still develop prototypes, for example proofs-of-concept for a technology or approach.

But our main goal is to test if the market actually wants the product, and not a prototype of it.

In this case we talk about Minimum Viable Product. Something that looks and feels like a real product, but with the minimum amount of features that allow to test customer interest. The investment in this case is focused on learning rather than building the ultimate product. This will come eventually by validating one by one all the features with real customers using the MVP.

Some say that this approach moves testing and product development in the end of the consumer, who pays for an half-finished not tested product.

This hasn't stopped Apple, Microsoft, and other many big brands to do it.

In order to quickly build an MVP, it is possible to use different parts and techniques which can get us acceptable results in a short time. This way rapid iteration can be developed.

## The western way: Open-source boards &  kits

Open source software, where anybody can access,  modify and redistribute the source code of a computer program, has allowed to create some of the most important products in our daily lifes. 

Android, Webkit, Linux are all examples of this largely successful approach.

These projects not only helped the world to get better software, but also served as the basis for new businesses competing in a market driven by very large corporations. 

For example Red Hat, now an Oracle company who developed a number of consulting services based on Linux for the enterprise, today  has several hundred million dollars turnover.

Open source hardware allows a similar freedom, attaching to digital designs of electronics and hardware all the source file needed to reproduce and modify them. On a theoretical level this is done to give the freedom to anybody to understand and tweak products, but on a practical level open source hardware makes up an incredibly rich toolset of components that can be used to quickly build interactive prototypes.

Having all the sources, it is later much easier to scale up production of compatible hardware based on the same design.

Arduino, Raspberry and other projects have proven to be exceptionally popular thanks to the very little technical knowledge required to program them. Useful as a teching tool, they can also serve to quickly build an MVP.

## The asian way: Gongban and Gongmo

Gongban and Gongmo are two terms used in China to indicate a well established hardware platform and enclosure that can be "borrowed" for creating a new product.

This "borrowing" is very popular, as IP property is not enforced by legal agreements but based on personal relationships between producers.

What this mean is that once a product and its design gets popular, the producer or someone else, will make it available for creating clones, with different functionality or shape. 

The more popular a design is, the fastest it will evolve into a stable platform and become available to more developers, who will make more products on it, making it even more popular.

Many examples exist, once for all consider USB Power Banks. They started to appear few years ago into the chinese market, driven by the diffusion of big screen smartphones needed to be charged more often. What you can find in the market today is just an evolution of that initial design, and if you tear apart
most of modern power banks, you will discover they contain exactly the same components, independently of their brand and packaging.

This way the original producers will profit selling components in even larger quantities, and the new entrepreneurs will be able to introduce very quickly new products to be tested in the market.

What gives market advantage is the innovation speed, being the first, and getting out new products that keep attracting customers before the competition is much more important than being the only able to produce something.
