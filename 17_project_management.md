# Project management

## Planning the work

Good project management can make the difference between 
a good idea and a good **execution** of it.

Once you identify your project development strategy it is time to start listing actions and defining exactly what needs to be done.

## Why planning?

During the product development phase, you will have a defined amount of time and some deadlines to be met for delivering various versions of it.

Each of these deadlines will serve as checkpoint for the product development, and often the result of each will be taken into account to keep developing the product or killing it.

Deadlines can be related to internal events, such as meetings with potential investors, and to external ones like trade events or competitors releases. 

For the actual production, planning has the objective to make sure you have enough stock of your product for the forecasted sales. But also to optimize costs and make economy of scale savings on raw materials and parts.

## Planning techniques and tools

## To Do Lists

For small projects, especially with a very limited group of people, you can do very informal planning. A shared online documents, listing one task per line, with striked lines indicating completed tasks can be a good planning tool.

For each task list what needs to be done, who needs to do it and when is due.

Reviewing the task lists each day can give an overview of what was achieved and what still needs to be completed. On the other side it is difficult to manage hundreds of tasks this way, for example to identify all the ones assigned to a person.

## Gantt charts

Gantt Charts come from the engineering world, and are used to visually represent not only tasks, but also the dependencies and critical paths between them.

A Gantt Chart adds to the plain todo list for each task, a start date and end date, as well as the one it depends from and the ones depending on it. 

A line representing the task duration is used for an easier understanding.

This technique is perfect for waterfall project development, but rarely the charts are fully respected, and needs to be continuosly updated to reflect the actual state of the project rather than the ideal world indicated into the chart.

## Kan Ban Boards 

A popular system born from the japanese industry, can be found today in many online software applications, such as Trello, Github, Gitlab.

A Kan Ban board allows to collect Cards into titled columns, for example labeled Todo, Doing, Done or taking the name of the different areas in the business. 

Each card can represent an activity or a task, and its position defines the status of the activity itself. Completed activities for example, will appear in the Done column, while those pending in the Todo one.

Associating all information about a task in a single card allows for easy reference and sharing the tasks with the working group.
