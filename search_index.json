overview of the process of turning a technological prototype into a real product, building a digital design, using digital fabrication for production, and following the lean startup approach for business aspects.\nDuring the workshop we'll first learn the basics of all the above, then we will apply this metodology to several real world projects, inspired by the current market trends.\nMethodology\nIn order to be more engaging for  participants, the workshop follows a roleplay approach. \nParticipants will be divided in groups and each one will represent a startup team including all the roles: management, communication, production, marketing and R&D.\nEach group will be led by a product manager who will be in charge of coordinating his team work and presenting the results of each day’s activities.\nIdeally, every day a new product manager will be selected, so all the participants will experience all the different roles.\nIn order to fully achieve the workshop objectives it is very important to respect the proposed schedule and make sure that participants have access to all the necessary tools and materials.\nFor this reason each of the proposed project briefs integrates a bill of materials and a number of pre-made parts which will be easily customized by the workshop participants.\nDuring the work participants will be introduced to different tools typical of the lean startup, such as the business canvas, kanban boards, MVPs, A/B testing, but will also deal with the design, fabrication and integration of the products.\nProject selection criteria\nThe proposed products have been selected in order to address the following:\n\nrepresent large market trends (consumer electronics, wearables, automation)\nbeing easy to customize in shape, materials and production means\nallowing fast integration and prototyping cycles using digital fabrication\nrequiring teamwork to produce an acceptable result\nbe engaging and fun to make\n\n"},"02_workshop_intro.html":{"url":"02_workshop_intro.html","title":"Workshop Introduction","keywords":"","body":"Workshop introduction\nWhat is Made in a Fab Lab\nMade in a Fab Lab is an atypical brand, created by Francisco Sanchez, available as open-source to anyone who wants to make and sell products built according to the principles of the Made in a Fab Lab Manifesto.\nThis way your product can gets immediately recognised as carrying the values of ethical and sustainable local production from a global design.\nBut it is also a tool to help us increase the awareness on this topic and prove that much can be still done using the power of the Fab Lab Network.\nMade in a Fab Lab Manifesto\nThe Made in a Fab Lab Manifesto was created for and by makers, biohackers and whoever else wants to promote self-made products that can be produced globally with a sustainable approach.\nAnybody can use the Manifesto as a guideline for creating and distributing products locally in a Fab Lab or Makerspace.\nA Manifesto for Global Design and Local Production\n\nFab Lab Made products include daily used objects, as well as art and design\nAll labour involved in their production is fairly compensated\nFab Lab Made products favour re-used, upcycled and local materials\nShared designs with open source licences keep their value over time and should be preferred\nDesigners and collaborators are fairly compensated for each product sold, even if their design is open\nFab Lab Made products are not harmful, dangerous or illegal\nFab Labs with the standard setup are able to produce most products\nProduction is mainly targeted at local markets, long distance shipping is avoided as it hurts the planet\nCompetition between labs shouldn’t exist as we are all part of the same global community\nThe Fab Lab made label only aim is the sustainability of the global fab lab network and its members\n\nWhat will you learn\nThe learning outcomes for the workshop are the following:\n\nLearn how a product is made from concept to mass production\nUnderstand the different phases and what roles contribute to the process\nLearn how to create a digital design for a product,

Either a potential customer made a specific request or the company management decided to pursue a business opportunity.\nWhat the brief tells is the expected result to be achieved, at the level of detail of a concept.\nOften the brief also include technical and usability requirements, which will have to be validated in the following phases.\nAn effective brief can save some time during development, but everything written has to be taken with precaution and checked continuosly during an extensive analysis of requirements.\nExcercise: make some examples of a product brief, starting from products you know\nRequirements\nThe goal of this phase is to define which are the requirements that the products needs to satisfy according to the different stakeholders involved, their usage scenarios and of course to the limitations imposed by technology.\nThe requirements phase is essential to achieve a good product, \nand requirements must be checked continuosly during all other phases.\nA shortcut taken to save some headaches for the production might negatively impact the product and in the end sales.\nRequirements must be checked against real users to be fully validated. Several approaches exist including user groups, interviews, study groups, A/B testing, etc.\nThe way we'll try to test requirements is quite revolutionary and only allowed by the recent technologies introduced with the digital fabrication.\nWhat we'll do is to test minimal working products, or MVPs with\npotential customers, asking what they think about them and what should be improved to build an optimal product.\nWe can also try selling these products in a local market for a more real-world scenario, but this needs to be done only when the product is mature enough (and safe) to be really useful to the buyer.\nExercise: try to define requirements for a simple object, for example the computer's mouse or touchpad\nDesign\nThe design phase follows a typical scenario in the consumer electronics world.\nThe technical components for the product often come from an existing product, or produced by a third party and ready to be integrated. \nEspecially in China, where tens or hundreds of variants of the same product flood the market before settling into a specific design, most of the products have the same intrinsic characteristics, while changing in components selection, design, materials, packaging and so on.\nIn order to be attractive to consumers, products need several design elements to be provided:\n\na sleek enclosure, communicating the level of the product in the market\na proper packaging \na coordinated image linked to the innovative features of the product\n\nStarting from the technological prototypes available, our task will be that of designing the above elements for our products, paying attention to production processes that will allow us to produce small batches at an affordable cost.\nExcercise: find products you like, and try to analyze all the design elements you can find in it\nPrototyping\nIn terms of rapid prototyping digital open designs, personal fabrication and open source hardware make today easy to achieve what required in the past a small factory.\nWe can quickly prototype a full product starting from modular electronic components, designing an enclosure, along with packaging and marketing materials all using only the equipment available in a Fab Lab.\nAs a basis of our prototype we can also use on the many available open source projects, which exist in practically all areas: drones, consumer electronics, machines, games, and much more.\nOur prototyping process will start from a dozen project selected or developed for the workshop. The participant's main task is to create a concept with digital design and produce an integrated prototype which can be used as an MVP for market validation.\nThe process will include using different machines, the 3D Printer for making plastic parts, the laser cutter for packaging and 2d interlocking design. The CNC mill for circuits and wax molds. During the workshop participants will discover molding and casting and vacuum forming projects.\nExcercise: find on the internet early prototypes of popular products, then note the difference between them and the actual product\nDocumentation\nThe documentation plays a crucial part in the development of a product. \nDuring this phase internal and external documentation is produced.\nProducing documentation is a collaborative process, so it's very important to track the changes and communicate edits to collaborators. During the workshop we will use tools that allow working together on documentation.\nWe will work on different documents including the requirements specification,\nthe production plan, the business canvas, and marketing plan.\nFinally all this content will feed into a singe project website containing all the information about the product.\nExcercise: give a bad and a good example of product documentation\nSharing / Marketing\n\n\n\n\nAn effective communication strategy can bring customers, investors and in general traffic to your product. Creating a strategy across different media such as web, social and traditional media is not easy but can be done with few resources if an effective planning is carried out.\nYou will need to draft a marketing plan allocating resources to each channel.\nFor starting the marketing activitiy you will make a splash website and a brand identity for your product.\nExercise: create an instagram account if you don't have one, and load at least one picture of the workshop with the tag #madeinafablabdubai\n"},"15_project_development.html":{"url":"15_project_development.html","title":"Project Development","keywords":"","body":"Project Development techniques\nWaterfall development\nBrief -> Requirements -> Design -> Prototyping -> Documentation -> Sharing\n\n\n\n\nSpiral development\nSame as the above, just repeated in a cycle, with very fast iterations.\nWe move to the next phase as soon as we have something to work on the next one.

But also to optimize costs and make economy of scale savings on raw materials and parts.\nPlanning techniques and tools\nTo Do Lists\nFor small projects, especially with a very limited group of people, you can do very informal planning. A shared online documents, listing one task per line, with striked lines indicating completed tasks can be a good planning tool.\nFor each task list what needs to be done, who needs to do it and when is due.\nReviewing the task lists each day can give an overview of what was achieved and what still needs to be completed. On the other side it is difficult to manage hundreds of tasks this way, for example to identify all the ones assigned to a person.\nGantt charts\nGantt Charts come from the engineering world, and are used to visually represent not only tasks, but also the dependencies and critical paths between them.\nA Gantt Chart adds to the plain todo list for each task, a start date and end date, as well as the one it depends from and the ones depending on it. \nA line representing the task duration is used for an easier understanding.\nThis technique is perfect for waterfall project development, but rarely the charts are fully respected, and needs to be continuosly updated to reflect the actual state of the project rather than the ideal world indicated into the chart.\nKan Ban Boards\nA popular system born from the japanese industry, can be found today in many online software applications, such as Trello, Github, Gitlab.\nA Kan Ban board allows to collect Cards into titled columns, for example labeled Todo, Doing, Done or taking the name of the different areas in the business. \nEach card can represent an activity or a task, and its position defines the status of the activity itself. Completed activities for example, will appear in the Done column, while those pending in the Todo one.\nAssociating all information about a task in a single card allows for easy reference and sharing the tasks with the working group.\n"},"04_project_requirements.html":{"url":"04_project_requirements.html","title":"Project Requirements","keywords":"","body":"Project requirements\nYou need to define project requirements in order to know what to build and why.\nThis is usually a long process as it requires extracting requirements from a number of different kinds of users, not keen to define what they need in terms\nof clear language.\nDefinining requirements means also understanding the product domain, being able to sketch out the possible users for the product and how they will use it during their daily routines.\nA number of techniques exist to define requirements, the one we will use can be described as follows.\nIdentifying stakeholders or personas\nWe first try to guess who will benefit for using our product. These are called stakeholders or in more modern models, personas.\nEach persona should be sketched as a real person. It is useful to give a name and draft a short profile for each persona.\nAccording to their profile each persona will have needs, expressions of the problem to solve with our product.\nFor each need we should provide a solution, in terms of how the person will use our product to solve it.\nUse cases\nFor each case that our product is used we can define a use-case. This will have the form of a title, a number of actions perfomed by the user or by the product, and the expected outcomes achieved.\nSpecial consideration must be taken for exceptions: the cases in which given a wrong input our product will handle failure gracefully.\nExplicit requirements\nOnce we identified the use cases, we can classify the actual requirements.\nThese should take the form of simple sentences, subject verb object\nThe requirements will drive our design phase and all the subsequent ones.\nEach requirements will be categorized in Mandatory, Optional, Nice to have.\nThis way we can make sure to have all the mandatory requirements implemented into our MVP, to be able to validate fully our product with the testing phase.\nThe requirements will be organized into three main categories:\n\nfunctional requirements: defining what the product does \n\nusability requirements: describing the details that should be taken into account in order to make a more usable product\n\ntechnical requirements: all the details about the product's technical features, as well as electrical / electronic components necessary for its operation\n\n\nExercise: sketch out stakeholders, use cases and requirements for one of the machines in the lab if you know them already, or one appliance in your house, like a tv, a fridge or coffee machine\n"},"05_workgroups.html":{"url":"05_workgroups.html","title":"Workgroups","keywords":"","body":"Workgroups\nCreating a product is group work.

We talk in this case about re-design. Famous examples include cars: Fiat 500 and Mini were a huge success in two different decades, still keeping a link from the old version to the new version, much like a DNA.\nWhat is different with a digital design compared to the traditional one?\nThe main difference is in the speed of execution and flexibility of the outputs. A digital design can be made in thousands of variants just changing few parameters. It can be scaled easily and also adapted to different customers with few clicks.\nIn order to be able to produce digital design we must learn how to use Computer Aided Modeling software packages.

Customers often only know they want something after they see it, and when it comes to understanding what a product does the same applies to coworkers and other people in your business.\nMinimum Viable Product\nWith the new Lean Startup movement the idea of prototype is given a major role in a project success. With this methodology we still develop prototypes, for example proofs-of-concept for a technology or approach.\nBut our main goal is to test if the market actually wants the product, and not a prototype of it.\nIn this case we talk about Minimum Viable Product. Something that looks and feels like a real product, but with the minimum amount of features that allow to test customer interest. The investment in this case is focused on learning rather than building the ultimate product. This will come eventually by validating one by one all the features with real customers using the MVP.\nSome say that this approach moves testing and product development in the end of the consumer, who pays for an half-finished not tested product.\nThis hasn't stopped Apple, Microsoft, and other many big brands to do it.\n\nIn order to quickly build an MVP, it is possible to use different parts and techniques which can get us acceptable results in a short time. This way rapid iteration can be developed.\nPrototyping function\nThe western way: Open-source boards &  kits\nOpen source software, where anybody can access,  modify and redistribute the source code of a computer program, has allowed to create some of the most important products in our daily lifes. \nAndroid, Webkit, Linux are all examples of this largely successful approach.\nThese projects not only helped the world to get better software, but also served as the basis for new businesses competing in a market driven by very large corporations. \nFor example Red Hat, now an Oracle company who developed a number of consulting services based on Linux for the enterprise, today  has several hundred million dollars turnover.\nOpen source hardware allows a similar freedom, attaching to digital designs of electronics and hardware all the source file needed to reproduce and modify them. On a theoretical level this is done to give the freedom to anybody to understand and tweak products, but on a practical level open source hardware makes up an incredibly rich toolset of components that can be used to quickly build interactive prototypes.\nHaving all the sources, it is later much easier to scale up production of compatible hardware based on the same design.\nArduino, Raspberry and other projects have proven to be exceptionally popular thanks to the very little technical knowledge required to program them. Useful as a teching tool, they can also serve to quickly build an MVP.\nThe asian way: Gongban and Gongmo\nGongban and Gongmo are two terms used in China to indicate a well established hardware platform and enclosure that can be \"borrowed\" for creating a new product.\nThis \"borrowing\" is very popular, as IP property is not enforced by legal agreements but based on personal relationships between producers.\nWhat this mean is that once a product and its design gets popular, the producer or someone else, will make it available for creating clones, with different functionality or shape. \nThe more popular a design is, the fastest it will evolve into a stable platform and become available to more developers, who will make more products on it, making it even more popular.\nMany examples exist, once for all consider USB Power Banks. They started to appear few years ago into the chinese market, driven by the diffusion of big screen smartphones needed to be charged more often. What you can find in the market today is just an evolution of that initial design, and if you tear apart\nmost of modern power banks, you will discover they contain exactly the same components, independently of their brand and packaging.\nThis way the original producers will profit selling components in even larger quantities, and the new entrepreneurs will be able to introduce very quickly new products to be tested in the market.\nWhat gives market advantage is the innovation speed, being the first, and getting out new products that keep attracting customers before the competition is much more important than being the only able to produce something.\nPrototyping shape\nLow tech\nPaper and Cardboard\n\nLow-fi prototyping\n\n3D Paper structures, Carboard machines\n\n\nClay\n\nLow-fi prototyping\n\nScanning & Reverse engineering\n\n\nCNC\n3D Printing\n\n3D printing for fast prototyping\n\n3D printing for molding\n\n3D printing in exotic materials\n\n\nLaser-cutting\n\nLaser cutting 2D shapes, parts\n\nLaser cutting for 3D structures\n\nLaser cutting for packaging\n\nLaser engraving\n\n\nCNC Milling\n\n2D Milling\n\n3D Milling\n\nMold making\n\n\nCustom machines\n\nWire bending\n\n"},"11_digifab.html":{"url":"11_digifab.html","title":"Digital Fabrication","keywords":"","body":"Digital Fabrication for Local Production\nDigital design\nThe design is a file in the computer\nDesign can be transferred\nScale is not a problem\nYou have a great choice of tools and processes for production\nMachines controlled by the computer\nWhat is the difference\nG-code is the code used by machines to receive instructions from the computer.\nFor 3D printers the G-Code is produced by a Slicing software, for CNC Mills by a CAM software, and for the others by specific applications.\nG-Code looks like this:\nO8001\nN10 (Digit \"1\")\nN20 (AUTHOR - NAME)\nN30 G00 X[#502*0.5+#500] Y[#502*1.0+#501] Z[#503+0.2]\nN40 Z[#503+0.05]\nN50 G01 Z[#503-#504]\nN60 Y#501\nN70 G00 Z[#503+0.2]\nN80 M99\ni.e. G0 is the command to move the machine head\nTechnologies & Processes\n3D Printing\n\nFDM\nSLS\nSLA\nMetals\n\nLaser cutting & engraving\n\nco2\nfiber\npcb\n\nVinyl cutting\n\nstickers\ntransfer\nwrapping\n\nMilling \n\nprecision\nlarge format\npcb\n\nMolding and casting\n\nsilicon\nconcrete\nsand\n\nInjection molding\n\nsilicon mold - desktop injection\nmetal mold - large scale\n\nMetal casting\n\ndelft clay casting\naluminium casting\nprecious metal casting\n\nPlasma, Fiber, EDM\nTermoforming\n"},"07_business_planning.html":{"url":"07_business_planning.html","title":"Business Planning","keywords":"","body":"Business Planning\nPlanning the business side of your project can be time consuming and frustrating. It's difficult since it requires you to make assumptions and research about how your product will be produced, sold, and which market it targets.\nBut since making a product requires lots of effort and resources, you want to be at least sure that you are making something that will eventually reach the market and sell well, making consumers happy and wanting more.\nLean startup for hardware\nThe traditional approach to start-ups and entrepreneurship in general has been shaken significantly by a number of books such as Business Model Revolution, introducing the trend of the so-called Lean Startup.\nTo simplify, the Lean Startup provides a number of guiding principles and tricks that help finding out sooner if a product works and when is time to produce it. \nIt is based on the key concept that in the early phases of a business there are a number of assumptions that need to be proven before moving on and considering the business worth investing in.\nMainly used in the software business,  The Lean startup can be applied to any kind of business, including those manufacturing hitech or low-tech products.\nThe main tool used to test assumptions in this case will be a Minimum Viable Product. This is a complete product, with only the features needed to test the customer reaction, ready to be improved if there's a good response, in a new product version.\nIf you think about it this is the model smart companies already use for most hi-tech products, refining the product at subsequent generations by constantly tweaking it in a couple of features.\nExercise: Take a marketing campaign and understand what assumptions the company would like to check\nElevator pitch\nThis is a short sales pitch, something that you will use to tell other people\nabout your product, but also what actually your product does in simple words.\nMake your elevator pitch guide you through the project, it must contain the essence of it.\nLearn pitching from Richard Branson (Virgin):\n\n\n\n\"As I have written previously, the first step toward delivering a great pitch is to keep it human, since far too many presentations and speeches can turn artificial and wooden quite quickly. Let your passion shine through by being yourself and allowing your points to come across naturally. Use humour to connect with your audience and demonstrate your creativity.\n\"A great pitch can do many things. It can convince potential investors and clients that you are worth taking a chance on. It can also help you recruit top talent that can help your business expand. These are essential ingredients for a successful venture. Keep in mind that people want to invest in people. So talk about your previous successes. \n\nExercise: Make an elevator pitch for a product you like\nBusiness canvas\nThe business canvas (or Lean canvas, depending on which book you prefer between the Lean Startup or the Business Model Revolution)\nis a simple but powerful tool allowing you to quickly transfer your (business) idea from your mind to a format you can share with other people.\nIn the past this would have required writing a Business Plan, a 100 pages document that would take few weeks at least. This will be necessary once the idea scales up, and you will be looking for investors. But for a preliminary feasibility check a canvas is all you need.\nWhat's in the Business / Lean Canvas?\n\n1. Problem\n In this box try listing the one to three high priority problems that your potential customer has. Without a problem to solve, you don’t have a product / service to offer.\n2. Customer Segments\nWhich are the categories of people which have the problem highlighted before and might need / want your product.\n3. Unique Value Proposition\nWhich value will deliver your product. Consider this as the main reason the buyer should choose your product and not one of a competitor for example.\n4. Solution\nWhat is the solution for the problem. It might be a technological solution, but you need to check with the potential customer if it's the right one they are willing to buy.\nAsking will also help you find other solutions worth investigating.\n5. Channels\nHow you will reach your customers, for marketing and selling your product. Focus on the channels you can afford, i.e. local newspaper ad vs superbowl 30'' adv, and make you learn more about your actual customers.\n6. Revenue streams\nHow you will make money with your product. Include any recurring revenue stream, for example service subscriptions, or licensing to third parties.\n7. Cost structure\nDescribe all costs for getting your product to the market. \nDefine how much money you need each month and match it to the revenue streams to find the break-even point (when expenses will be equal to income, after covering all the losses).\n8. Key Metrics\nHow will you measure your product success, for examples number of sales, \nsubscriptions, growth per quarter, etc.\n9. Unfair Advantage\nThis should include what your competitors cannot get and you have in terms of advantage. For example a patented technology, the founders expertise in a specific field, specific territorial assets.\nExmple\nHere an example of a Lean canvas for a business\n\nExercise: pick a random business idea an try to make a business canvas for it, for example an icecream shop for vegans, a training center for tiny dogs, a restaurant where they serve only green food, etc\n"},"08_marketing.html":{"url":"08_marketing.html","title":"Marketing & Communication","keywords":"","body":"Marketing & Communication\nBrand and identity\nDefining your project branding is very important to make it stand out from the competition and to become an added value for future projects.\nThere are many ways to create a brand, from DIY to thousand dollar bills for famous design studios.\nIn any case you can start with a self-made graphics and move to a fancier one when the product is on the shelfs.\nThe identity should include color and black and white versions, optimized for print. Adapt your identity to best represent the product values and your market segment. I.e. blue color for medical products, green color for energy products.\nTake inspiration from major brands and opt for simple geometric shapes.\nExercise: make a new logo for Made in a Fab Lab\nMarketing materials\nOnce you defined your brand identity, you should be able to use it in different materials.\nThe bare minimum will be a web-friendly version of your logo in png format,\nand a color theme for the splash website.\nUsually products come with flyers, posters, brochures, advertisements. \nExercise: make a flyer for an upcoming Made in a Fab Lab workshop\nProject Video\nThe first way to promote your product is to make an interesting video, not\nnecessary longer than 30 seconds.\nThe video should answer the most common questions immediately:\n\nWho are you?\nWhat does your product?\nHow do you use it?\nWhy it is better then the others?\nHow do I get it?\n\nYou can also make several additional videos highlighting a specific feature\nor use of your product. Think about the Apple commercials.\nExercise: make a 30 second video with your mobile phone, describing a product you like and share it on Instagram using the #madeinafablabdubai tag.\nProject Website\nA lean website is a minimum for any product. People will look at it while deciding what to buy, checking for a new model or looking for support answers.\nA splash webiste is enough for a new product. Just one page with pictures describing the features and allowing for example to pre-order the product when available.\nAs you have more content, you can add new pages and start to redesign a more complex site.\nA pre-order form can be easily developed with Google Forms.\nIf you want just to collect the email addresses you can use Mailchimp\nThe majority of users come from mobile. Make sure your website can be rendered optimally from a smartphone.\nExercise: look for a website you like, and try to outline the main sections or pages\nA/B Testing\nYou can maximise your product potential by giving your customers the best possible experience and A/B testing is a proven way of finding out precisely what works.\nFor using A/B testing you set up two different pages on your website for example.\nIn each you will write different marketing slogans, or hilight a different feature of your project.\nThen you will promote separately the two addresses, for example using marketing\ncampaigns on Google.\nGoogle provides everything needed to check which pages are more appreciated, and understanding this way what your customers like best.\nThis way you will be able to use your customers to improve a little by a little\nall the content of your marketing materials.\nExercise: take some of the materials you made during the day, and make an alternative version, changing the slogan with a different phrase. Then ask the other participants which they like best.\nSocial media\nYou should consider social media as one of the most active channels for hi-tech products and local communities.\nPost nice looking pictures and short but effective copy to attract visitors and future customers.\nMake sure you cover the main social media in your area, those that people use most will work.\nSocial media only work if they are updated often. Twice a day is a common strategy.\nIn order to maximize social media impact, a posting calendar is often used, planning the publishing of posts at regular intervals.\nSome tools exist to automate these tasks, such as Hootsuite. They also provide help in tracking social interactions with the customers.\nExercise: take a sample product you like and list all the social media you would advertise it on, for example twitter accounts, instagram, facebook pages, online magazine\n"},"09_financing.html":{"url":"09_financing.html","title":"Financing options","keywords":"","body":"Budget\nYour funding goal should be the minimum amount you need to make the required quantity of products to test your idea or fullfil your existing orders.\nHow to figure out a budget\n\nMake a list of all the possible expenses, starting from the bill of materials, but also including anything from screws to envelopes.\n\nAdd taxes and any kind of commission for your business model. Paypal takes 3% for every transaction, you might have to grant discounts to local shops offering your product. Add a fixed percentage for bank expenses.\n\nMake sure your work and those of who helped you with open-source resources get properly compensated. \n\n\n\nTIP: Ask for an average salary for an engineer or other professional in your country, divide it by 20 and you have a one day of work pay, multiply it by the days you need to work on the project for an estimate.\n\nBudget Template\nBudget template below\n\n\nFinancing options\nSelf-funding\nGroup with friends and family and invest in your idea. Also\nhaving co-funders will help gathering some initial money to \nstart production. Aim low for producing a small series before investing all your family's savings.\nAngel investors\nAngels invested over $20 billion in 2014, financing over 70,000 companies. Usually an angel investor is an entrepreneur who has already built a successful company and now wants to invest in new ideas and help you build your company. \nAngel investor Chris Sacca invested $25,000 and a lot of time in Twitter, a bet that helped Twitter grow and gave him approximately $1 billion worth of shares.\nFor your company, develop a target list of angel investors. Work from this list to manage the entire process. Be sure to keep notes from each conversation and incorporate feedback into your next conversation.  The easiest way to reach a lot of angel investors is through angel groups.\n(Forbes)\nIncubators\nA business incubator is an entity that helps new startups develop their business with advice, startup services, and often times office space. They are either for-profit, non-profit, or government / University sponsored. \n(Forbes)\nCrowdfunding\nCrowdfunding is a relatively new phenomenon. Platforms like Kickstarter, Indiegogo and GoFundMe make raising money straightforward because they streamline the processes of giving entrepreneurs access to a large volume of potential investors. \n(Forbes)\nExercise: go to kickstarter.com and check successful projects. Write down how much they asked initially, how much they got and how the project go. Find at least one unsuccessful project\nVenture capital\n Today, many venture capitalists make early and later stage investments. That means you might not get all the money at once, but you have the potential to get more as you prove success through traction. \n But you have to have a solid plan in place first. Find someone you know to make a warm introduction. Don’t cold call -- ever. You will not get a favorable response. Make sure your pitch is solid and that you have strategic partners in place, customer validation, and your advisors ready to be a reference.\n (Forbes)\n"},"10_fulfillment.html":{"url":"10_fulfillment.html","title":"Fulfillment","keywords":"","body":"Production\nPlanning production\nMake sure there is sufficient capacity to meet the demand forecast.\nA carefully developed production plan will allow your company to meet the following objectives:\n•  Minimize costs / maximize profits\n•  Maximize customer service\n•  Minimize inventory investment\n•  Minimize changes in production rates\n•  Minimize changes in work-force levels\n•  Maximize the utilization of plant and equipment\nDemand forecasting\n\"How many products will I need to produce in August 2017?\"\nMake an estimate of products needed for each time period, make it a month, or three.\nDefine what needs to be produced, and then using the BOM what needs to purchased, how many man hours will be needed, and so on.\nIf you have more than one product, make individual estimates\nand then aggregate them into a single list of products.\nPlan to meet the requirements\nDefine how to cover the forecasted requirements, both on the production level (hiring staff, buying machinery, finding external suppliers) and on the financial level (for production and tools costs)\nMake different plans and compare them to find the one with the lowest cost.\nHow to deal with flexible demand\nProduce just-in-time, hire staff or use existing services for scaling the production only when needed.\nMany models exist for this problem, re: Demand Chase vs Level production strategy.\nRelying on third parties\nProduction can be a difficult process, especially for large batches.\nYou can deal with local production for the first few thousands parts without setting up a factory. After that you should consider alternative production models.\nNetworking with other labs or companies can be an option. \nFinally delegating production to a third party can scale to millions of parts in the long run.\nKickstarter provides an extensive list of suppliers for design, manufacturing, packaging, logistics etc.\nSales and order fulfillment\nOnce your product is ready to be produced, you should figure out:\n\nHow / where to sell your product: online, in shops, in large consumer stores,  only via resellers\n\nHow will you get your product to the customer from the factory or local shop.\nThis will often involve shipping to a warehouse and getting in place agreements with courier services.\n\n\nFor massively produced goods the two items above are really problematic, and companies spend years for achieving an optimal sales and logistic network.\nFor Made in a Fab Lab products this will be reduced to a short checklist:\n\nHow much stock you can afford to produce and keep ready for shipping\n\nWhich are the channels you want to use for selling your product, maybe a friend's shop or only online through your website, or just directly.\n\nEven if shipping locally you might want to consider finding out a local\ncourier service or to arrange a dropout location at a local post office.\n\n\nIn any size of business you will need to make invoices and keep accounting records. Many online services allow you to track accounting using your\nbrowser. One example is Quickbooks.\nSome offer also integration with online shopping platforms such as\nShopify which you could also consider for your online\nsales, but only when you have more than one product.\nShipping costs must be taken into account very seriously. Designing a compact product and packaging can save substantial amounts.\nPlanning production\nYou need to plan your production according to many different factors, even for small numbers, when producing in-house or using third party partners. \nFinally you need to figure out how to handle production scaling to large numbers if sales go really well.\nWhat you need to take into account include:\n\nhow many products need to be produced for a given date\nparts or components to be acquired on the market or custom - built\ninventory for consumables and assembly materials\npackaging and other accessory material\nlogistics for all the above\nhow much staff you need to make the final products, and how or when to increase the production and so much more.\n\nThere are a number of issues that make planning an hard problem when\ntalking about an hardware product.\n\nYou don't know exactly how many products will be sold in a specific time of the year. You could make guesses based on season: for example have more stock for the christmas season if your product is a toy for kids.\n\nYou can control your stock of parts and materials, but have little control over the stock of your suppliers, especially if your product is made my many different components from differente suppliers. What can be easy to find in small quantities can be hard to find in thousand of units. Also parts can be discontinued.\n\n\nProduction batches\nIt is common for hardware products to arrange production in batches. For example a first batch for pre-orders, then a second batch to be sold online, and finally other batches to be sent to physical shops.\nA batch can also correspond to a different product iteration, with subsequent batches delivering each time a more refined version. This happens a lot in consumer electronic products, where few tweaks are done per batch or per destination country, also linked to different suppliers of the same part.\nThe real advantage of production batches is linking them with pre-orders.\nThis way each batch is pre-payed by the customers, and only the necessary quantity of each product is produced, when the number of orders reaches a certain amount.\nSomething similar happens with crowdfunding campaigns where you collect orders and money from customers well before having the actual products.\nIn this case the production batches will match the so-called rewards, the perks that crowdfunding projects give to the customers, usually including the product but not only. This will add other tasks to the work plan, since\nit might involve producing and delivering gadgets, t-shirts or other items to the customers.\nGetting payed\nIn order to get payed for your online sales, you will need to setup an online\naccount for this purpose, usually on Paypal or Stripe. Both will require a commission for each sale, and to verify your account linking a credit-card or a bank account.\nYou will be asked for such an account when activating a Shopify account or pretty any other online ecommerce system.\nThe credit card processors are very useful for collecting payments, but you should consider moving money to a traditional bank as soon as possible, in order to be able to pay suppliers, salaries and so on.\n"},"12_project_briefs.html":{"url":"12_project_briefs.html","title":"Project Index","keywords":"","body":"Project briefs\nCONSUMER ELECTRONICS\nDRONE QUAD COPTER\nThe company needs to design a quadcopter for taking pictures at events and parties.\nWe selected the electronic and mechanic design, based on Daniele Ingrassia’s satshacopter project, that can be made using two or more digital fabrication technologies, processes and tools.\nWe recommend the laser cutter to make the frame and packaging, the 3D printer to make a shell for it and the vinyl cutter to complete the box.\nThe project should include the product concept statement and its documentation in order to easily replicate the product in any lab.\nPRODUCT REQUIREMENTS\n\nLightweight as possible and less than 0.5 kg, able to carry a gopro camera\nAttractive and futuristic look\nGood picture quality\nEasy to control for a newbie\nEasy to produce in any lab in maximum 4 hours\n\nMACHINES AND TOOLS REQUIRED\n\nLaser cutter\n3D printer\nVinyl cutter\nSoldering iron \n\nBILL OF MATERIALS\n\nPlywood and Cardboard\nVinyl\nOpen source flight controller \nMPU6050 IMU located exactly at the center\n4 x 1900kv brushless motors\n4 x 15A ESCs\nMultiWii compatible\nHobby King 4 channel remote and receiver\n1000mah 3S LiPo battery\n\n\nBLUETOOTH MP3 SPEAKER\nThe company is looking for a innovative mp3 / bluetooth speaker which can be easily produced using injection molding processes with different materials, composed of two or more different pieces, in order to minimize part complexity.\nThe product designer must design and prototype their concept proposal based on the preliminary CAD files provided.\nThe project should include the product concept statement and its documentation in order to easily replicate the product in any lab.\nPRODUCT REQUIREMENTS\n\nDimensions: 80x80x25mm maximum \nLow part complexity\nInclude space for electronics, battery and wiring\nAllow to insert an SD-card\nProvision for recharging the battery\nSimple button / LED interface \n\nMACHINES AND TOOLS\n\n3D printer\nLaser cutter\nPrecision CNC Mill, i.e. Roland SRM-20 \nSoldering iron\n\nBILL OF MATERIALS\nBluetooth / MP3 board (ready-made)\nSpeaker panels\nLipo battery\nControl panel\nButtons\nResistors\nLEDs\n\nDIGITAL ASSISTANT\nB&R Devices Corporation, Leader in consumer electronics, is looking for a new kind of digital assistant product to launch in 2018.\nThe target of the product is able to interact with the user using the Amazon Alexa and provide several kind of data including weather, appointments, sport results, movie hours, etc.\nThe product should be affordable and easy to produce with digital fabrication technologies and processes.\nThe technology stack used will be based on the Chip PRO linux board, that integrates directional microphones and wireless connectivity.\nDesigners should craft an elegant shell around the electronics, taking into account tolerances and access to the Chip IO ports and power supply.\nThe final solution should have a retail value of 100 $ or less.\nThe project should include the product concept statement and its documentation in order to easily replicate the product in any lab.\nPRODUCT REQUIREMENTS\nAffordable.
